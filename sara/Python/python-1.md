# Python Fundamentals – Learning Progress

This document tracks my foundational Python learning as part of my AI and Machine Learning journey.

Building strong programming fundamentals is essential before moving into data science and advanced machine learning topics.

---

# Topics Covered

So far, I have completed the following core Python concepts:

## 1️) Booleans and Conditionals

- Understanding `True` and `False`
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Writing `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Using booleans for branching logic

I learned how programs make decisions based on conditions.

## 2️) Lists

- Creating lists
- Accessing elements using indexing
- Modifying list values
- Adding and removing elements
- Iterating over lists

Lists allow storing and managing multiple values efficiently.

---

## 3️) Loops and List Comprehensions

### Loops
- `for` loops
- Iterating through lists
- Using `range()`
- Nested loops

Loops help automate repetitive tasks.

### List Comprehensions
- Writing concise one-line loops
- Creating filtered lists
- Improving readability and efficiency

Example:

```python
squares = [x * x for x in range(5)]
```

## 4) Strings

- String creation and manipulation
- String methods (`lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, etc.)
- String slicing
- Formatting strings

Strings are essential for working with text data.

## 5) Dictionaries

- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing values by keys
- Adding and updating key-value pairs
- Looping through dictionaries
- Using `.get()` for safe access

Dictionaries are powerful for structured and labeled data storage.

## Skills Developed

Through these topics, I have strengthened:

- Logical thinking
- Problem-solving ability
- Code readability practices
- Understanding of data structures
- Writing clean and structured Python code

## Why This Matters for AI & Machine Learning

These concepts form the foundation for:

- Data manipulation
- Feature engineering
- Working with datasets
- Writing ML pipelines
- Understanding algorithms

Without mastering these basics, advanced AI topics become difficult.

## Next Learning Goals

- Functions
- Error Handling
- File Handling
- NumPy and Pandas
- Introduction to Machine Learning
