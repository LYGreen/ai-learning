Thank you for inviting me to this collaborative learning project.

I will try my best to update my parts regularly in my folder (`sandip/`) with notes, scripts, and progress. I appreciate the opportunity to learn together and contribute.

Let's enjoy learning AI! if you want, you can add my discord (ly_green) 😊

And also, you can directly upload files to this repo, it's okay!
